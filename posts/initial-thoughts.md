honestly this started way before today, but todays the day I decided to write a blog on everything that happened ðŸ«¡.
## who are we?

a group a students determined to score well on (mostly math) Olympiads.

## why are we doing this?

some faggots tried to nuke our server to "prevent leaking". see how that backfires.

## what else do we have?

usaco, usabo, fma, usnco, quite a bit actually.

## do we "leak"?

not really. leaking devalues the test, something that neither of us want.
